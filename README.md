TestED (Eclipse plugin)
=======================
TestED is an Eclipse plugin that will parse your Java tests and related source
code and suggest improvements to you concerning testing. This is done 
by analysing method parameters and arguments as well as the output from 
at least two tests that passes for each corresponding.
