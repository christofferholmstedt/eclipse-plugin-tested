TestED (Eclipse plugin)
=======================
TestED is an Eclipse plugin that will parse your Java tests and related source
code and suggest improvements to you concerning testing. This is done
by analysing method parameters and arguments as well as the output from
at least two tests that passes for each corresponding method.

TestED is developed as a project in the course "CDT412 - Software Engineering
Project" at MÃ¤lardalen University in Sweden. For more information please visit
