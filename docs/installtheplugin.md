When you have downloaded the .jar file place in your eclipse "dropins" folder
before you start eclipse. The plugin should now be loaded and it should work
right out of the box.

You can test to see if the plugin is working by trying out the "Example" found
in the menu on your right. Expected results are the hints/suggestions found in
the bottom of the example page. Those hints should show up within eclipse in your
problems tab right after you have run JUnit test cases.
